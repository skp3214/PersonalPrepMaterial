## Type of OS

### [1. MultiProgramming Operating System]()
- A MultiProgramming Operating System is one that allows multiple programs to be loaded into main memory.
- It increases CPU utilization by organizing jobs so that the CPU always has one to execute.
- If a program waits for certain event, another program is immediately given to the CPU to execute.

### [2. Multitasking/Time Sharing Operating System]()
- A Multitasking/Time Sharing Operating System allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.
- It uses time slicing to allocate CPU time to each user or process, giving the illusion of parallelism.
- Each user can interact with their program while the OS manages the execution of multiple programs in the background. 

### [3. MultiProcessing/Tightly Coupled Operating System]()
- A MultiProcessing/Tightly Coupled Operating System is one that uses multiple processors to execute multiple processes simultaneously.
- It provides high performance and reliability by distributing the workload across multiple CPUs.
- It requires special hardware support and is typically used in high-end servers and supercomputers.

### [4. Real-Time Operating System]()
- A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is one that is designed to process data as it comes in, typically without buffering delays.
- It is used in environments where a large number of events must be processed in a short time, such as embedded systems, robotics, and industrial control systems.
- RTOS are characterized by their ability to guarantee response times and are often used in safety-critical applications.

  #### [4.1. Hard Real-Time OS]()
  - A Hard Real-Time OS is one that must meet strict timing constraints and deadlines.
  - It is used in applications where missing a deadline could result in catastrophic failure, such as in medical devices, aerospace, and industrial control systems.
  - Hard Real-Time OS are designed to be predictable and reliable, with minimal jitter and latency.

  #### [4.2. Soft Real-Time OS]()
  - A Soft Real-Time OS is one that does not have strict timing constraints and can tolerate some degree of latency.
  - It is used in applications where timely processing is important, but not critical, such as in multimedia systems, video games, and interactive applications.
  - Soft Real-Time OS are designed to provide a balance between responsiveness and resource utilization.
