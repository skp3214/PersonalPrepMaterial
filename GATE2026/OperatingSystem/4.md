## Process Management

- In general, a process is a program in execution.
- It is an active entity, as opposed to a program, which is considered to be a passive entity.
- A Program becomes a process when the executable file is loaded into main memory and it's Process Control Block (PCB) is created.

- A `Process` consists of following sections;

  - [Text Section]() : also known as Program Code.
  - [Stack]() : where temporary data is stored, such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables.
  - [Heap]() : used for dynamic memory allocation, where variables are allocated and freed in an arbitrary order.
  - [Data Section]() : contains global and static variables.

### [Process Control Block (PCB)]()
- The Process Control Block (PCB) is a data structure used by the operating system to store all the information about a process.
- It contains important details such as:
  - Process ID (PID)
  - Process state (running, waiting, etc.)
  - Program counter (PC)
  - CPU registers
  - Memory Limits
  - I/O status information (list of open files)
