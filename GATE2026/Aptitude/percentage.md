## Percentage

Based on the image, here are notes and short tricks for percentage calculations:

- **Consecutive Increases**: To find the total effect of multiple percentage increases, multiply their decimal equivalents. For example, three 10% increases equal a 33.1% overall increase (1.1 x 1.1 x 1.1 = 1.331).

- **Successive Discounts**: Two consecutive 50% discounts don't add up to a 100% discount. Instead, they result in a total discount of 75% (0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25, which means 25% remains).

- **Mixed Changes**: A 50% increase followed by a 50% decrease results in a net 25% decrease (1.5 x 0.5 = 0.75). Similarly, two consecutive decreases of 50% and 20% give a total 60% decrease (0.5 x 0.8 = 0.4, which means 40% remains).
