### Leap Year Calendar Repetition

- The calendar for a leap year repeats after **28 years**.
- For a non-leap year, the calendar repeats after **6 years**.
- The calendar for the 2nd and 3rd years after a leap year repeats after **11 years**.
- After this cycle, the leap year pattern starts again.

> **Tip:** This repetition is due to the way odd days accumulate over years and the leap year cycle in the Gregorian calendar.
