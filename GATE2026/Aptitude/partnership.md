#### Ratio of Division of Gains

- **Equal Time Investments:**  
    If all partners invest their capital for the same duration, profits (or losses) are divided in the ratio of their investments.

    > **Example:**  
    > If A and B invest Rs. *x* and Rs. *y* respectively for a year:  
    > **A's share : B's share = x : y**

- **Different Time Investments:**  
    If partners invest for different periods, calculate each partner's *capital-time product* (capital × time invested). Profits are then divided in this ratio.

    > **Example:**  
    > If A invests Rs. *x* for *p* months and B invests Rs. *y* for *q* months:  
    > **A's share : B's share = x × p : y × q**
