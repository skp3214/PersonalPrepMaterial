## Code Execution in JavaScript

Here's how **Global Execution Context (GEC)**, **Memory & Code Phase**, **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**, and the keywords `var`, `let`, and `const`  are related to JavaScript code execution:

---

### ‚úÖ **1. Global Execution Context (GEC)**

When JavaScript starts running, it creates a **global execution context**:

* It has two phases: **Memory Creation Phase** and **Code Execution Phase**

---

### ‚úÖ **2. Memory Creation Phase (also called Creation Phase / Memory Phase)**

In this phase:

* **Memory is allocated** to variables and functions **before** execution
* Variables declared with:

  * `var` ‚Üí initialized with `undefined`
  * `let` & `const` ‚Üí allocated memory, but **not initialized**
* Functions ‚Üí entire function is stored in memory

---

### ‚úÖ **3. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**

* It‚Äôs the **time between memory allocation** and **initialization** of `let` and `const`
* Accessing `let` or `const` **before their initialization** causes a **ReferenceError**
* `var` does **not** have TDZ, as it is initialized with `undefined`

---

### ‚úÖ **4. Code Execution Phase**

Now JavaScript **runs the code line-by-line**:

* It assigns actual values to `var`, `let`, and `const`
* Executes functions when invoked

### üîÅ **How All These Are Connected:**

| Concept          | What Happens                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **GEC**          | Created when script runs                           |
| **Memory Phase** | JS scans code, allocates memory                    |
| `var`            | Hoisted with value `undefined`                     |
| `let` / `const`  | Hoisted but uninitialized (in TDZ)                 |
| **TDZ**          | Accessing `let`/`const` before initialization = error |
| **Code Phase**   | JS runs top-to-bottom, assigns real values         |

### üß† Example to Tie It Together:

```javascript
console.log(a);    // undefined (var is hoisted)
console.log(b);    // ReferenceError (in TDZ)
console.log(c);    // ReferenceError (in TDZ)

var a = 10;
let b = 20;
const c = 30;
```

### üí° Summary in One Line:

JavaScript first creates a **global execution context**, where it **hoists** all declarations (allocates memory), then **executes code**, and the **TDZ** ensures `let` and `const` can‚Äôt be accessed before initialization.
